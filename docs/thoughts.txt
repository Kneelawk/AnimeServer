Things I want:
Users with the ability to upload files.
Users can keep how far they are through videos.
Shows have aliases.
Search bar.

How should anime be organized?
I want dubs and subs to be together. (Maybe with the possibility of alternate dubs and subs?)
I want to be able to keep track of who uploaded which files.
Maybe something like:
/<Show Name>/<ISO 639-2 spoken-language>[-<ISO 639-2 subtitle-language>]/<Season, OVA, or other>[ <number>]/Episode <number> - <Episode Name>.mp4

Maybe if multiple files were submitted for the same episode then the episode is a directory instead of a file:
/<Show Name>/<ISO 639-2 spoken-language>[-<ISO 639-2 subtitle-language>]/<Season, OVA, or other>[ <number>]/Episode <number> - <Episode Name>/<sha-256>.mp4

Each directory may have a single metadata file: metadata.json
metadata.json contains all information on a directory and, through the "children" node, the directory's children,
potentially including subdirectories, each potentially containing their own "children" nodes.

When ever metadata is saved to the filesystem, metadata for subdirectories contained in those directories' parent's
metadata.json is moved to metadata.json files contained in those subdirectories.
This happens because the metadata for a whole directory is loaded into memory when needed, but when saved, it is
distributed across the directory's subdirectories as necessary.

If there is a conflict between information in a parent's metadata.json file about a child directory and the information
in that child directory's metadata.json file when loading metadata, the child directory's metadata.json file overrides
the data about the subdirectory in the parent's metadata.json file.
